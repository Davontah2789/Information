### **Assignment: Creating a GitHub Account and Linking Your Assignment Code**

#### **Objective:**
The purpose of this assignment is to guide you through the process of creating a GitHub account using your school email, entering a unique assignment code, and linking the account to your name. This will help familiarize you with GitHub for future collaboration and version control tasks.

#### **Steps:**

### **Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account**
1. Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the **Sign up** button at the top-right corner.
3. Enter your school email address (ending in `@snyc.student.net` or similar).
4. Create a strong password and follow the prompts to complete the sign-up process.
   - **Note**: Use a **strong password** to secure your account.
5. Once you have successfully created your GitHub account, verify your email address by checking your school email inbox for a verification message from GitHub and following the instructions.
   
### **Step 2: Forking the Assignment Repository**
1. Your instructor will provide a GitHub repository link with an assignment code.
2. Open the link to the assignment repository.
3. Click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of the page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
   
### **Step 3: Linking Your Name to the Assignment Code**
1. Navigate to the `README.md` file or any specified file within the repository that contains a list of students or contributors.
2. Find the section that includes the placeholder for your name (e.g., `Student Name: ______`).
3. Edit the file by clicking the pencil icon (ðŸ–‰) in the upper-right corner of the file.
4. Replace the placeholder with your full name, and in parentheses, add your GitHub profile link. For example:
   ```markdown
   Student Name: Jonathan Cruz [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/your-username)
   ```
5. Once you've made the changes, scroll down and write a short commit message (e.g., "Added Jonathan Cruz and GitHub link").
6. Select the option **Commit directly to the main branch**, then click the **Commit changes** button.

### **Step 4: Submitting the Assignment**
1. After making your changes, go back to your forked repository.
2. Ensure that your changes have been saved and the assignment is complete.
3. Copy the URL of your forked repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/assignment-repo`).
4. Submit the URL of your forked repository to your instructor via your course platform (e.g., Blackboard or email).
